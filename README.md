# Static webpage

This is a simple web project using [Tlalokes framework 1.0](http://gitorious.org/tlalokes).
I created this project just for fun and learning a little bit more about github.

Fot the webpage you can find the use of the framework to multilanguage site, jQuery for gallery slides, and JS with Mootools for a dynamic map.
