3. Requirements.

 3.1 PHP. Tlalokes Framework requires the PHP language version 5.2.x or later.

 3.2 Web Server. Actually Tlalokes has been probed with Apache, we are working
     to make it available for any web server that supports PHP 5.2.x or later.

 3.3 Libraries. Tlalokes Framework include and uses the following libraries,
     some of them are required only in case that you want specific features.

     - Propel. Tlalokes Framework uses and includes Propel as Object-Relational
       Mapping (ORM) framework. It allows you to access your database using a
       set of objects, providing a simple API for storing and retrieving data.

       You can read more about Propel at <http://propel.phpdb.org/>.

       If you want to use ORM in your application do not remove this library.

     - Creole. Creole is a database abstraction layer for PHP5. It abstracts
       PHP's native db-specific API to create more portable code while also
       providing developers with a clean fully object-oriented interface based
       loosely on the API for Java's JDBC.

       You can read more about Creole at <http://creole.phpdb.org/>.

       Propel requires Creole

     - Phing. Phing it's a project build system based on Apache Ant. You can do
       anything with it that you could do with a traditional build system like
       GNU make, and its use of simple XML build files and extensible PHP "task"
       classes make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework.

       You can read more about Phing at <http://phing.info/>.

       The Propel generator requires Phing.

     - PEAR. PEAR is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP
       components. The purpose of PEAR is to provide:
       * A structured library of open-source code for PHP users.
       * A system for code distribution and package maintenance.

       You can read more about PEAR at <http://pear.php.net/>.

       Phing and the Propel runtime requires PEAR as its Logging system, but can
       use another logging system, you can change this if you want at the Propel
       runtime configuration.

     - Smarty. Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically, it
       facilitates a manageable way to separate application logic and content
       from its presentation.

       You can read more about Smarty at <http://www.smarty.net/>.

       Tlalokes uses Smarty as it default template engine, but you can modify it
       to use another one.


4. Installation.

   Tlalokes is divided in three areas: the framework, your application and your
   public area.

 4.1 The framework.

  4.1.1 Download. You can download the framework from http://tlalokes.org/

  4.1.2 Uncompress. You can uncompress the framework at /usr/local/tlalokes or
        /opt/tlalokes or other directory of your preference to make it available
        for any application in your system.

 4.2 Your application.

  4.2.1 Path. Tlalokes will create your applications directory, but it needs of
        your help to know the path where your application is going to be
        located. By example at /home/user/application.

  4.2.2 Permissions. Tlalokes needs permissions to generate and modifiy your
        application. If you have superuser access make your application's
        directory property of the web server user (www, www-data, nobody, etc.).
        If you have no superuser access then you can change your application's
        directory's permissions to be writeable by the web server user, by
        example chmod a+w /your/path/to/application

 4.3 Your public area.

  4.3.1 Example. You can copy the contents of the directory example to your
        public area. Your public area must contain the index.php and the
        .htaccess (for Apache)

  4.3.2 Index file. Edit your index.php and customize the variables $tlalokes,
        $app and $uri.

        - $tlalokes is the path of the framework (4.1)
        - $app is the path of your application (4.2)
        - $uri is the URI or URL where your application will be loaded from.

 4.4 Load the URI. If the previous steps are complete, just load your
     application's URI and complete the wizard.

 4.5 Admin. If you want to manage your application in a very easy way, download
     and use the admin of Tlalokes.
